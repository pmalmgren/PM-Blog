#About the Site
I decided to start a blog to share my breakthroughs, frustrations, and thoughts about developing software. I love developing Python, Objective-C/Swift, and web applications. 

##Web Stack
All the posts are written in markdown, processed by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and served as a static page on my webserver. I've also incorporated [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to handle many of the mundane tasks such as copying files, compiling SASS, replacing text in HTML files, and watching for changes and automatically regenerating the site

I deploy my blog using [Rsync](http://rsync.samba.org/) to my Digital Ocean account. The whole blog is available on [Github](https://github.com/ptmalmgren/petermalmgren.com).  

##Road Map
I also have plans to combine AngularJS and Jekyll to serve the blog as a single page web app. I anticipate Grunt playing a large part of this workflow, due to the Liquid syntax conflicting with the Angular syntax. 

#About Me
I'm a web and mobile application developer from Charlotte, North Carolina. I love learning about new technology, watching Star Trek, writing code, hiking, and enjoying the good local beer Charlotte has to offer. 

If you find something that you like, dislike, or for some other reason would want to get in touch with me, feel free to contact me at ptmalmgren (at) gmail dot com.
