I'm a dad and [software engineer](https://github.com/pmalmgren). I live in the mountains of North Carolina, and currently work as a Product Engineer at [Zapier](https://zapier.com).

I've worked for a [few other organizations](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ptmalmgren/), but the work I'm most proud of is my time as an electrician in the Navy, and my research for [Dr. Souvenir](https://cis.temple.edu/~souvenir/) in Computer Vision and Machine Learing.

When I'm not parenting or working, which account for 70% of my waking hours (!), I enjoy hiking, reading, podcasts, learning, lifting weights, cooking, and occasionally writing on this blog.
