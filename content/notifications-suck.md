## The problem with knowledge sharing at work

During my previous two jobs, I spent a lot of time answering questions on Slack, email, Jira, GitHub, and other tools. A lot of the time, these questions were the same as ones which had been asked dozens of times before.

And unfortunately, because of the way we receive information through notifications, it is hard to sort through and pick out the relevant or important messages from the rest.

I have seen my teammates, often times some of the most valuable and most productive members of the team, run into this problem too. In the best case it can be an annoyance. In the worst case, it can lead to burn out.

### Why current solutions are bad

Knowledge sharing is sometimes solved through something like an internal service desk, customer support hero, or some kind of Slack channel dedicated to answering questions. The problem with these approaches is that they pull engineers, product managers, designers, and other valuable teammates away from doing the work they were hired to do.

Sometimes, teams will try to use something like Confluence or Google Docs as a centralized place to store information. But as companies grow, tools change, and people forget to update documentation. Then companies end up with a disorganized mess of out of date documents.

## How I want to solve this problem

I'm building a tool focused on internal customer support and knowledge management. Here are the three main goals of the product:

- Provide a way to structure, organize, and manage incoming internal customer support requests, with a focus on clarifying priority and context of notifications to improve focus
- Provide automations to common work flows (escalate to ticket, defer to another team, answer common questions, etc.) to provide clarity and transparency to the customer support process
- Provide a simpler way to keep your organization's body of knowledge up to date, without editing documents, and without leaving the apps you already use

If you've struggled with any of these problems and what I've said resonates with you, I encourage you to fill out [my beta signup form](https://petermalmgren.typeform.com/to/IHduWwGL).

And if you put your email in, I promise not to spam you. I'll just send you an email with an invitation code when the app is ready to use.
