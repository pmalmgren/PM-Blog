I'm trying to make communication and knowledge sharing over Slack less of a pain. I'm just starting out and don't have a product yet, but I want to make sure that I'm building something that actually helps solve this problem.

I've only ever had experience with this problem as an engineer, and am interested in building a tool that helps everyone on a team ask and answer questions without interrupting each other so much.

If you have experience with this problem I would love to hear from you! You can book some time directly on my [calendar here](https://calendly.com/peter-malmgren/30minchat) or let me know about what you [struggle with here](https://petermalmgren.typeform.com/to/IHduWwGL).
