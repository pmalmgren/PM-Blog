I'm building an app to manage, sort, and prioritize your notifications. If you're interested, fill out the {{< rawhtml >}} <a href="https://petermalmgren.typeform.com/to/IHduWwGL" onclick="fathom.trackGoal('B5PGZD9N', 0);">beta signup form.</a> {{< /rawhtml >}}

## The problem with notifications

During my time as a software engineer at a fast growing startup I frequently ran into a few painful problems with notifications:

- Notifications arrive without context or priority, other than a red dot
- Notifications arrive at anytime, making it hard to focus
- Notifications are easy to lose, especially when you have so many of them
- Notifications arrive from different sources, making them hard to link together
- The act of responding to a notification can be wasted effort, especially if you are answering the same questions over and over

## A solution

To solve these problems I have been developing a universal inbox tool to help collect, centralize, and prioritize notifications. 

The MVP is somewhat limited in its feature set, but here is what it will focus on:

- A way to automatically ingest notifications from a variety of SaaS apps, using a Zapier integration
- A UI to view notifications from every app, sorted by person or project
- User-defined filters to automatically prioritize notifications, so you'll know what to focus on first

If any of these solutions seem useful to you, or if you think I've missed anything important, {{< rawhtml >}} <a href="https://petermalmgren.typeform.com/to/IHduWwGL" onclick="fathom.trackGoal('B5PGZD9N', 0);">please let me know!</a> {{< /rawhtml >}}
